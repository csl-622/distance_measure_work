A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A.A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  The &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention--there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories.  However, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, the first Ace book not in [[dos-a-dos]] format appeared, [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners''; and the very next title was another innovation: [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'' was the first [[science fiction]] title for Ace.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]] he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= [[James A.

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  The &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention--there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories.  However, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= [[James A. Corrick]]| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]] he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  The &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention--there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories.  However, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= [[James A. Corrick]]| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]] he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  The &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention--there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories.  However, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  The &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention--there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories.  However, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

*Other genres: [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Double Titles|Doubles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Letter-Series Single Titles|Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Numeric-Series Single Titles|Numeric-Series Singles]]

Two combined listed are given, one for all [[List of Ace Double Novels|Ace Doubles]], of whatever genre, and another list of all the [[List of Ace Single Volumes|Ace Singles]].  However, the following lists give the individual series titles, for all genres.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  The &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention--there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories.  However, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]].

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P.

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  The &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention--there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories.  However, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W.

A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).

Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G.

Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R.

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but, Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'' bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A.A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by George Doran in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by George Doran in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Clute, John &amp; Nicholls, Peter| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

*[[mystery fiction|Mysteries]]: [[List of Ace Mystery Double Titles|Mystery Doubles]], [[List of Ace Mystery Letter-Series Single Titles|Mystery Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Mystery Numeric-Series Single Titles|Mystery Numeric-Series Singles]]
*[[western (genre)|Westerns]]: [[List of Ace Western Double Titles|Western Doubles]], [[List of Ace Western Letter-Series Single Titles|Western Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Western Numeric-Series Single Titles|Western Numeric-Series Singles]]
*Other genres: [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Double Titles|Doubles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Letter-Series Single Titles|Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Numeric-Series Single Titles|Numeric-Series Singles]]

Two combined listed are given, one for all [[List of Ace Double Novels|Ace Doubles]], of whatever genre, and another list of all the [[List of Ace Single Volumes|Ace Singles]].  However, the following lists give the individual series titles, for all genres.

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= St. Martin's Press, Inc.| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]], a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by George Doran in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]], a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]], a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.

* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]], a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

==Editors==
The following people worked at Ace Books in various editorial roles.

* [[A. A. Wyn]] &amp;mdash; owner (1952-1967)
* [[Donald A. Wollheim]] &amp;mdash; editor (1952-1971)
* [[Pat LoBrutto]]&lt;ref name=chicon /&gt;
* [[Beth Meacham]]
* [[Jim Baen]]
* [[Terry Carr]]
* [[Tom Doherty]]
* [[Terri Windling]]
* [[Ginjer Buchanan]]

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

*[[science fiction|SF]]: [[List of Ace SF Double Titles|SF Doubles]], [[List of Ace SF Letter-Series Single Titles|SF Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace SF Numeric-Series Single Titles|SF Numeric-Series Singles]]
*[[mystery fiction|Mysteries]]: [[List of Ace Mystery Double Titles|Mystery Doubles]], [[List of Ace Mystery Letter-Series Single Titles|Mystery Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Mystery Numeric-Series Single Titles|Mystery Numeric-Series Singles]]
*[[western (genre)|Westerns]]: [[List of Ace Western Double Titles|Western Doubles]], [[List of Ace Western Letter-Series Single Titles|Western Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Western Numeric-Series Single Titles|Western Numeric-Series Singles]]
*Other genres: [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Double Titles|Doubles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Letter-Series Single Titles|Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Numeric-Series Single Titles|Numeric-Series Singles]]

Two combined listed are given, one for all [[List of Ace Double Novels|Ace Doubles]], of whatever genre, and another list of all the [[List of Ace Single Volumes|Ace Singles]].  However, the following lists give the individual series titles, for all genres.

* [[List of Ace Titles in first DGS series|D/G/S-series]].  599 volumes.
* [[List of Ace Titles in second G series|G-series]].  About 266 volumes.
* [[List of Ace Titles in F series|F-series]].  About 330 volumes.

* [[List of Ace Titles in H series|H-series]].  About 108 volumes.
* [[List of Ace Titles in K series|K-series]].  About 207 volumes.
* [[List of Ace Titles in A series|A-series]].  Probably 30 volumes.
* [[List of Ace Titles in N series|N-series]].  4 volumes.

In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]], a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

==Editors==
The following people worked at Ace Books in various editorial roles.

* [[A. A. Wyn]] &amp;mdash; owner (1952-1967)
* [[Donald A. Wollheim]] &amp;mdash; editor (1952-1971)
* [[Pat LoBrutto]]&lt;ref name=chicon /&gt;
* [[Beth Meacham]]
* [[Jim Baen]] &amp;mdash; complaints department (c. 1973-1974); gothics editor (c. 1974); sf editor (c. 1977-1980)&lt;ref name=chicon /&gt;
* [[Terry Carr]]
* [[Tom Doherty]]
* [[Terri Windling]]
* [[Ginjer Buchanan]]
* [[Anne Sowards]]

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

*[[western (genre)|Westerns]]: [[List of Ace Western Double Titles|Western Doubles]], [[List of Ace Western Letter-Series Single Titles|Western Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Western Numeric-Series Single Titles|Western Numeric-Series Singles]]
*Other genres: [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Double Titles|Doubles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Letter-Series Single Titles|Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Numeric-Series Single Titles|Numeric-Series Singles]]

Two combined listed are given, one for all [[List of Ace Double Novels|Ace Doubles]], of whatever genre, and another list of all the [[List of Ace Single Volumes|Ace Singles]].  However, the following lists give the individual series titles, for all genres.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W.

For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

==Editors==
The following people worked at Ace Books in various editorial roles.

* [[A. A. Wyn]] &amp;mdash; owner (1952-1967)
* [[Donald A. Wollheim]] &amp;mdash; editor (1952-1971)
* [[Pat LoBrutto]]&lt;ref name=chicon /&gt;
* [[Beth Meacham]]
* [[Jim Baen]] &amp;mdash; complaints department (c. 1973-1974); gothics editor (c. 1974); sf editor (c. 1977-1980)&lt;ref name=chicon /&gt;
* [[Terry Carr]]
* [[Tom Doherty]]
* [[Terri Windling]]
* [[Ginjer Buchanan]]
* [[Anne Sowards]]
* [[Ellen Kushner]]
* [[Frederik Pohl]]
* [[Laura Anne Gilman]]

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

==Editors==
The following people worked at Ace Books in various editorial roles.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[The Putnam Berkley Group|Putnam]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

==Early History==

The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]], a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[G.P. Putnam's Sons|the Putnam Berkley Group]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate=2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[G.P. Putnam's Sons|the Putnam Berkley Group]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

*Other genres: [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Double Titles|Doubles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Letter-Series Single Titles|Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Numeric-Series Single Titles|Numeric-Series Singles]]

Two combined listed are given, one for all [[List of Ace Double Novels|Ace Doubles]], of whatever genre, and another list of all the [[List of Ace Single Volumes|Ace Singles]].  However, the following lists give the individual series titles, for all genres.

* [[List of Ace Titles in first DGS series|D/G/S-series]].  599 volumes.

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[G.P. Putnam's Sons|the Putnam Berkley Group]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H. Doran|George Doran]] in 1920; copy description located in second-hand bookstore {{cite web | url = http://www.robertwrightbooks.com/ | title = &quot;Robert Wright Books&quot; | accessdate = 9 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;but Ace published hundreds of titles bound in this way over the next twenty years, and became much the best known publishers of the format.  Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[G.P. Putnam's Sons|the Putnam Berkley Group]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

Books by established authors were often bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit.  The statement &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover was not a guarantee, as many books labelled thus were in fact cut significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|  year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York| | pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second title, also [[dos-a-dos]], was a [[western (genre)|western]]: [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''.  [[mystery fiction|Mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]] alternated, more or less regularly, for the first thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either genre such as [[P.G. Wodehouse's]] ''Quick Service'', bound with his ''The Code of the Woosters''.  In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''The World of Null-A'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first [[science fiction]] title.  An earlier Ace Double included [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as [[science fiction|sf]], but the book it was bound with was not [[science fiction|sf]], and so the van Vogt is generally regarded as Ace's first foray into the genre.  Another [[science fiction|sf]] Ace Double followed later that year, and [[science fiction|sf]] was rapidly established alongside [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] as a regular part of Ace's output.

The very next book after the van Vogt double was another first: [[Dorothy Malone]]'s ''Cookbook for Beginners'' was the first Ace book that was not in [[dos-a-dos]] format.

By the late 1950's, Ace's output was approaching a hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the three main genres.  Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and there were a handful at 50 cents.  In the early sixties, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and more; a few fat volumes such as the 1966 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''Dune'' were priced at 95 cents.  Other genres began to make a much more frequent appearance, as well; scores of &quot;nurse romances&quot; appeared, beginning in 1960 with [[Joan Sargent]]'s ''Cruise Nurse'' bound with ''Calling Dr. Merriman'' by [[Margaret Howe]].  By the end of the decade perhaps seventy more had appeared, along with gothic novels, self-improvement books, &quot;strange but true&quot; books, and many others.

==Lord of the Rings Controversy==
In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 to the present==
[[Image:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|frame|The cover to [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''And Chaos Died'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series.]]

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].  During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series; and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series.  ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace Books in [[1971]] the series moved elsewhere.

[[A. A. Wyn]] died in 1968, and the company grew overextended, and failed to pay its authors reliably.  Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to the authors.  On at least one occasion a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1971]] both [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr|Carr]] left Ace.  Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]]&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]].  [[Terry Carr|Carr]] became a freelance editor; both [[Terry Carr|Carr]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes.
In [[1972]], Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]].  In 1974, [[Patrick LoBrutto]] became the [[science fiction|SF]] editor, and was succeeded in the late 1970's by [[Jim Baen]], who left in 1980 to join the newly formed [[Tor Books]].  In 1982, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] were acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]; Ace were reputedly the only profitable element of the [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] empire by this time.&lt;ref name=chicon&gt;{{cite web | author=Bloom, Jeremy| year=1999| title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen | work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen| url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ace soon became the [[science fiction|sf]] imprint of their parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html | accessdate = 10 May | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[G.P. Putnam's Sons|the Putnam Berkley Group]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

*Other genres: [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Double Titles|Doubles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Letter-Series Single Titles|Letter-Series Singles]], [[List of Ace Miscellaneous Numeric-Series Single Titles|Numeric-Series Singles]]

Two combined listed are given, one for all [[List of Ace Double Novels|Ace Doubles]], of whatever genre, and another list of all the [[List of Ace Single Volumes|Ace Singles]].  However, the following lists give the individual series titles, for all genres.

==Early History==

[[Image:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|frame|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''.  The book on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.]] In 1952, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], who was then working at [[Avon Books]], persuaded [[A. A. Wyn]] to found a new paperback publishing company, Ace Books, with [[Donald A. Wollheim|Wollheim]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | pages = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book published by Ace was a pair of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01.  A [[dos-a-dos]] book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to one another, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (perhaps with some advertising pages in between).  This &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was not Ace's invention&amp;mdash;there had long been devotional books bound [[dos-a-dos]], as well as occasional books in other categories&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Irvin S. Cobb]]'s ''Oh! Well! You Know How Women Are!'' bound [[dos-a-dos]] with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]'s ''Isn't That Just Like A Man!'', was published by [[George H.

[[Terry Carr|Carr]] returned to Ace Books in [[1984]] as a freelance editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.   This series was even more sucessful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]'s ''Neuromancer'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''The Wild Shore'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In The Drift''; all are first novels by authors now regarded as major figures within the [[science fiction|sf]] genre.

In [[1996]], [[Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired [[G.P. Putnam's Sons|the Putnam Berkley Group]], and has retained Ace as their [[science fiction|sf]] imprint.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in [[1952]] with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about [[1972]] as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the [[Louis Trimble|Trimble]] would have been about 58000.

For the later numeric series titles, the number is also part of the [[ISBN]]. To form the [[ISBN]] (if it exists) for one of these books one prefixes &quot;0&quot; for English language/US, and &quot;441&quot; (Ace's publisher number), to the serial number.  The last digit can then be calculated with an ISBN check digit calculator.  For example, [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s ''Escape Velocity'' has serial number 21599; the ISBN is 0-441-21599-8.
