[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, and [[Lockheed Hudson]] and [[Vultee Vengeance]] [[light bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp; Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, and [[Lockheed Hudson]] and [[Vultee Vengeance]] [[light bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, and [[Lockheed Hudson]] and [[Vultee Vengeance]] [[light bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in both the British and Australian Armies, before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; 

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the [[Middle East Theatre of World War II|Middle East]] in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service with the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as Headquarters Air Command, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], they recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2 May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash-landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. A depreciatory communique concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]]) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, acting on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], the Spitfires recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2 May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash-landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]]) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, acting on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], the Spitfires recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of their own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2 May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash-landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]]) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, acting on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two of its own number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2 May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash-landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]]) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, acting on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the Pacific theatre of operations when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2 May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash-landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]]) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, acting on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later [[Air Vice Marshal]]) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]] on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]] Sir) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]] in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in country [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later Air Vice Marshal) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in country [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]] Sir) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as DCAS to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a property at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] (later Air Vice Marshal) [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander (later [[Air Marshal]] Sir) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]] at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], which he named ''[[Ad astra (phrase)|Adastra]]''. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson &quot;Frank&quot; Bladin''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early earning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;No 38 (Airborne Force) Group]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herington |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf |title=Air Power Over Europe |pages=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 |title=Bladin, Francis Masson |work=[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll] |accessdate=2009-4-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;No 38 (Airborne Force) Group]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herington |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf |title=Air Power Over Europe |pages=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 |title=Bladin, Francis Masson |work=[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll] |accessdate=2009-4-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]].

One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1920. He transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] during 1934&amp;ndash;35. Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. 

Quiet but authoritative, Bladin gained the nickname &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt; Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, his roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC [[RAAF Air Command|Eastern Area]], and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, Bladin retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command|RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command|RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laveron Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumbarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940.

He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangers and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC [[RAAF Command]], the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at Bradfield Park, New South Wales, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC [[RAAF Command]], the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]] in Sydney, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:P00474.006Bladin1941.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Commodore Bladin (second from left) with Lieutenant General Sir [[Stanley Savige]] (left) and Major Generals [[Cyril Clowes]], [[James Harold Cannan|James Cannan]] and [[Sydney Rowell]], Melbourne, December 1941]]
Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC [[RAAF Command]], the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]] on Sydney's [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School, Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC [[RAAF Command]], the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]] on Sydney's [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced in the ''Australian Gazette'' on 23&amp;nbsp;November 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=378992 Awarded: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC [[RAAF Command]], the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]] on Sydney's [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&amp;VeteranID=1204610 Bladin, Francis Masson] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/ World War W2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (26&amp;nbsp;August 1898 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in rural [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1920. Bladin transferred to the RAAF in 1923, and held training appointments before taking command of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed &quot;Dad&quot; in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

A staff officer at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Bladin became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|Japanese air raids]] on [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. He personally led [[sortie]]s against enemy territory, earning the United States [[Silver Star]] for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to [[No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]] in Europe, where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] the same year.

Among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF, Bladin's roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] in Japan, AOC Eastern Area (later [[RAAF Air Command]]), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. Bladin was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

==Early career==
[[File:P00448.196Wapiti1934.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Wapitis of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron at Laverton, November 1934]]
Frank Bladin was born in [[Korumburra, Victoria|Korumburra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[engineer]] Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;Dalkin, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.192&amp;ndash;193&lt;/ref&gt; Educated to junior public level at [[Melbourne High School]], he sought to join the [[Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, his parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;&gt;Stephens &amp; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.54&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;&gt;Dennis et al, ''Oxford Military History of Australia'', p.259&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the [[Australian Army]] and on attachment with the [[British Army]], before transferring to the RAAF as a [[Flying Officer]] in January 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennis&quot;/&gt; Undertaking pilot training at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], Victoria, he was one of five former army [[Lieutenant]]s on the inaugural RAAF flying course, all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war world. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]], [[Sub-Lieutenant]] [[Joe Hewitt (RAAF officer)|Joe Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.192&lt;/ref&gt; During 1925&amp;ndash;26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]], Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Magennis at [[Yass, New South Wales]], on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1955'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Flight Lieutenant]], he attended [[RAF Staff College, Andover]] during 1929&amp;ndash;30, and produced an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for ''Royal Air Force Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p.445&lt;/ref&gt; 

Promoted [[Squadron Leader]], Bladin took over as [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] from Squadron Leader [[Frank Lukis]] in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.2&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the unit, flying [[Westland Wapiti]]s and [[Hawker Hart|Hawker Demons]] out of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]] in Victoria, &quot;had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous&quot;. Bladin proceeded to change this, transporting the squadron 300 miles away to [[Cootamundra, New South Wales|Cootamundra]] in rural [[New South Wales]] for two weeks commencing late November 1935. He &quot;borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.190&amp;ndash;191&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his posting with No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron in December,&lt;ref name=&quot;Units&quot;/&gt; Bladin was appointed [[Officer Commanding]] Cadet Squadron at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School. He modelled the training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, [[Air Force Training Group RAAF#RAAF_College|RAAF College]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp.95,200&amp;ndash;201&lt;/ref&gt; which would be established in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.186&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt; On 12&amp;nbsp;March 1937, he was promoted [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;

==World War II==

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of [[World War II]] was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted [[Group Captain]] in June,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; he became [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Southern Area in August 1941 and was raised to acting [[Air Commodore]] the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin served briefly as Assistant [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]]  (Operations) in early 1942,&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison p.298&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/14.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', p.298]&lt;/ref&gt; before taking over as AOC North-Western Area (NWA) on 25&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/27.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.554&amp;ndash;559]&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], his role was to conduct the air defence of [[Torres Strait]], the [[Northern Territory]], and north [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; He also had to restore morale following the [[Bombing of Darwin]] on 19&amp;nbsp;February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.554-559&quot;/&gt; Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin proceeded to construct secondary airfields with which to disperse his forces. He became, in the words of Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens, &quot;the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war&quot;, and earned the distinction of being the first Australian decorated by the United States in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of operations]] when he was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es on Celebes in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied [[bomber]]s managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] during their return to base.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt; Bladin's award was recommended in September,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00306/003060628.pdf Recommendation: US Silver Star] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

[[File:NWA0450Bladin1943.jpg|thumb|180px|right|upright|Bladin (right) as AOC North-Western Area, with a Dutch Naval officer, 1943]]
By December 1942, Bladin's strength consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly [[Bristol Beaufighter]] and [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters, [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[light bomber]]s, and [[A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] [[dive bomber]]s. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s and USAAF [[B-24 Liberator]] [[heavy bomber]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp.649&amp;ndash;651]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35841|supp=yes|startpage=13|date=1 January 1943|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin continued to conduct offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the [[Timor Sea|Timor]] and [[Arafura Sea]]s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.145-146&quot;/&gt; On 27&amp;nbsp;February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield near [[Kupang|Koepang]] that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin. To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillison pp.649-651&quot;/&gt; A major engagement over Darwin on 2&amp;nbsp;May resulted in eight Spitfires being destroyed and others crash landing through engine failure or lack of fuel, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' &quot;heavy losses&quot; and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], that the &quot;alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots&quot;. He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]] against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based, which destroyed four enemy aircraft on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.46-50&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.46&amp;ndash;50]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17&amp;nbsp;June, under the command of Group Captain [[Clive Caldwell]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers pp.59-60&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.59&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[380th Air Expeditionary Wing|380th&amp;nbsp;Bombardment Group USAAF]], consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.61&quot;&gt;Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]] in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was &quot;well organised, keen and in good shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odgers p.104&quot;&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.104]&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of [[No. 38 Group RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;38 Group RAF]], Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herington pp.14-15&quot;&gt;Herington, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/29/chapters/02.pdf '' Air Power Over Europe'', pp.14&amp;ndash;15]&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a mission on D-Day, 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to [[Normandy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; and was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=36544|supp=yes|startpage=2642|date=8 June 1944|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing his RAF service on the staff of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in October 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;High Fliers&quot;/&gt; On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC [[RAAF Command]], the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with Air Board directives, but in the end no change was made to command arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', pp.154&amp;ndash;159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:133308Bladin1947.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Air Vice Marshal Bladin reviews BCOF troops, [[Tokyo]], May 1947]]
The RAF was planning to deploy an airborne formation, No.&amp;nbsp;238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre as the war came to a close in August 1945, and had requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command. In the event, his next posting was to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure, Japan]], in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to [[Lieutenant General]] [[John Northcott]], commander of the [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]] (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin for his operational and staff command experience during World War&amp;nbsp;II in both the RAAF and the RAF, as well as his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having come from a purely Air Force background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.212&amp;ndash;213&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted acting Air Vice Marshal on 1&amp;nbsp;March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]], in June 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephens pp.212-213&quot;/&gt;  After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir) [[Frederick Scherger]], in reshaping the post-war Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, he became Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.69&amp;ndash;70&lt;/ref&gt; His acting rank of Air Vice Marshal was made substantive on 1&amp;nbsp;October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:JK0138Bladin1951.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bladin straps into the rear seat of a [[Gloster Meteor]] during a visit to [[Korean War|Korea]], 1951]]
As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at [[RAAF Bradfield Park|Bradfield Park]] on Sydney's [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]], namely the former Lapstone Hotel at [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]]. Known today as [[RAAF Base Glenbrook|Headquarters Air Command]], the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. In addition to its commanding view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within five kilometres of the [[City of Penrith]] and thirty kilometres of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered &quot;complete protection from [[Nuclear weapon|Atom Bomb]] attack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Going Solo&quot;/&gt; Bladin succeeded Joe Hewitt as Air Member for Personnel on 24&amp;nbsp;November 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.500&lt;/ref&gt; and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.185&lt;/ref&gt; RAAF Staff College opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, offering advanced service education aimed at Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, Bladin sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their [[Academic degree|degree qualifications]] with formal [[Diploma of Education|teaching credentials]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following year, aircrew training was broken out from a single course at No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, into courses at the newly formed No.&amp;nbsp;1 Initial Training School at [[Archerfield, Queensland|Archerfield]], [[Queensland]], No.&amp;nbsp;1 Basic Flying Training School at [[Uranquinty]], New South Wales, and No.&amp;nbsp;1 Applied Flying Training School at Point Cook.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.199&lt;/ref&gt; Bladin had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] announced in June 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34396|supp=yes|startpage=3088|date=8 June 1950|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a [[Station (Australian agriculture)|grazing property]], which he [[Ad astra (phrase)|named ''Adastra'']], at Yass, just north of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, Bladin was treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Services League]] in 1965. In the early 1960s he also helped raise funds for building the Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in [[Balwyn, Victoria|Deepdene]], Frank Bladin was buried at [[Springvale, Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;/&gt;
