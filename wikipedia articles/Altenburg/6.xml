'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within the former Slavic area east of [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of € 451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within the former Slavic area east of [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within area, that after the Thuringian Kingdom's destruction in 531 by the Frankish Empire had Slavs east of [[Saale]] river move in, who remained, while German cities (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement) were built. The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within the former Slavic area east of [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and became one of the first German cities in Thuringia. The Thuringian Kingdom was in 531 destructed by the Frankish Empire and the Thuringian leaders were dukes of the Frankisch Empire. In 631/32 the first Slavs were mentioned, who repeatedly held plundering raids into Thuringia and other Frankish lands. Thuringian Duke Radulf I. (+ 658/9) defeated the Sorbs and made a treaty with them Slavs, who had moved in east of [[Saale]] river, remained, while German cities (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement) were built. The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and became one of the first German cities in Thuringia. The Thuringian Kingdom was in 531 destructed by the Frankish Empire and the Thuringian kings were from then dukes of the Frankisch Empire. In 631/32 the first Slavs were mentioned, who repeatedly held plundering raids into Thuringia and other Frankish lands. Thuringian Duke Radulf I. (+ 658/9) defeated the Sorbs and made a treaty with them Slavs, who had moved in east of [[Saale]] river, remained, while German cities (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement) were built. The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within the former Slavic area east of [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within the former Slavic area (before it was inhabited by Germanic tribes, before by Celtic tribes, and before by Western Linear Pottery Culture) east of [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within area, where by AD 631/2 Slavs first moved in, after the Thuringians began to be ruled by the [[Franks]] in area of [[Germania]], recorded by [[Tacitus]] and [[Ptolemy]], inhabited by Germanic tribes and earlier Western [[Linear Pottery Culture]]) east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities in area known as Germania where Slavic people had moved into, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were abandoned. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line were ceased in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) runs approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights on this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north) and the next major airport is [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport|Berlin]], {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. 6 lines connect the outlying quarters to the downtown. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.


The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north). 

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becomng a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style. 
* The Cemetery Church at Hospitalplatz was built between 1639 and 1651 in Renaissance style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

''For a detailed view of Altenburg's administrative division, see the [[:de:Liste der Stadtteile von Altenburg|list in German Wikipedia]].''

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and Demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===

When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}; {{lang-hsb|Starohród}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style. 
* The Cemetery Church at Hospitalplatz was built between 1639 and 1651 in Renaissance style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)

Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government. 
* The former ''Landgericht'' at Pauritzer Platz was built in 1859 in Neo-Renaissance style and hosts the social court now. 
* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city centre (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the centre. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the centre itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the centre and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city centre is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.
 
[[File:Stadtteile - Altenburg 2009.png|thumb|left|District map]]

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town centre of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

==== Churches ====
* St. Bartholomew's Church, built between 1428 and 1443 in Gothic style at Burgstraße, is Altenburg's main evangelical parish church. 
* The Fraternity Church at Marktplatz is another evangelical parish church, founded as a [[Franciscans]] monastery during the 12th century. It was abandoned after the Reformation in 1529 and reused as evangelical church. Today's building was established in 1905 in Neo-Gothic style. 
* St. Nicholas' Church at Nikolaikirchhof was the first church of Altenburg, mentioned in 1140. It was demolished during the 16th century, only the steeple remains. 
* St. George's Chapel is the castle's church, built in picturesque Gothic style during the mid-15th century. 
* St. Mary's Monastery ([[Augustines]]) is a former monastery on a hill east of the centre. It was founded during the 12th century and abandoned in 1543. Only the two Romanesque towers and some walls remain, being the city's landmark called &quot;Rote Spitzen&quot; (red spires).   
* The Duchess Agnes Memorial Church at Hausweg is an evangelical church, built between 1903 and 1906 in historist style.

==== Ducal buildings ====
* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city centre. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.
* Further buildings within the castle complex are the ''Junkerei'' in the north, built in the 16th century, the ''Flasche'', an old castle tower from the 11th century, the ''Hausmannturm'', built in the 12th century as the castle's keep as well as the ''Prinzenpalais'' and the ''Hofmarschallamt'' in the south, built after a fire in 1868. 
* Next to the castle lies the ''Schlosspark'' (castle park) with some more ducal buildings: the Baroque ''Teehaus'' (tea house) (1712), the Baroque ''Orangerie'' (1712) and the historist ''Marstall'' (1851). 
* The ''Amtshaus'' was built between 1725 and 1728 in Baroque style at Burgstraße and is now used as district court. 
* The ''Kanzlei'' was the seat of some ducal authorities, built in 1476 at Brühl. 
* The ''Neues Ministerium'' at Lindenaustraße was built in 1895 in Classicist style and is now the seat of the district government.

* The ''Landesbank'' (federal state bank) at Burgstraße was built in 1865 in Neo-Renaissance style. Currently, it is vacant.
* The Ducal [[Mausoleum]] in Altenburg Cemetery (burial site of several Dukes and Duchesses), now in ruins (those buried there removed to other parts of the cemetery in 1974).

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local centre of culture with theatre and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]]. The B7 and B93 bypass the town centre on a ring road to absorb the transit traffic between Leipzig and Zwickau.

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.

=== Education ===
There are three [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasiums]] in Altenburg: two state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical).

'''Altenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Altenburg.ogg|listen}}) is a city in [[Thuringia]], [[Germany]], located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Dresden]] and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[Erfurt]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district and part of a polycentric old-industrial textile and metal production region between [[Gera]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] with more than 1 million inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of 33,000.

Altenburg was first mentioned in 976 and later became one of the first German cities within former Slavic area, east of the [[Saale]] river (as part of the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]] movement). The emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] visited Altenburg several times between 1165 and 1188, hence the town is named a [[Barbarossa city|Barbarossa town]] today. Since the 17th century, Altenburg was the residence of different [[House of Wettin|Ernestin]]e duchies, of whom the [[Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg|Saxe-Altenburg]] persisted until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Industrialization reached Altenburg and the region quite early in the first half of the 19th century and flourished until the [[Great Depression]] around 1930. Economic malaise set in while Altenburg was in [[East Germany]] and continued after German reunification in 1990, evidenced by a decline in population, high unemployment and house vacancy rates.

The main sights of Altenburg are the castle, the [[Lindenau-Museum]], the historic city center (most buildings are from early-modern origin) and the [[Gründerzeit]] architecture around the center. The popular German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] was developed in Altenburg during the 1810s and the founder of the famous [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]], [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]], lived and worked in Altenburg between 1810 and 1817.

Altenburg lies in the flat and fertile landscape of [[Osterland]] on the [[Pleiße]] river in the very east of Thuringia, next to the neighboring federal state of [[Saxony]].

[[File:Schloss Altenburg 02.JPG|thumb|left|Castle of Altenburg]]
[[File:Nikolaiviertel Altenburg.JPG|thumb|The Nikolai quarter is one of the oldest parts of Altenburg]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The town (''civitas Altenburg'') was first mentioned in a deed to the [[Zeitz|Bishop of Zeitz]] in 976. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg (&quot;Castle Hill&quot;) demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by placenames, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the [[imperial road]] '[[Via Imperii]]' between [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle on the Elster|Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg as one of their [[Kaiserpfalz]]es, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the [[Groitzsch]] family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the ''[[Pleissnerland|Terra Plisnensis]]''. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meissen. Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. A [[priory]] of [[canons regular]] was founded and the [[parish church]] was finished in 1172. The twin towers of the 12th century Augustine monastery (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall with 5 gates was constructed at the end of the 12th century. Altenburg got its charter around 1200, in 1256 the Wettins confirmed it again. The law structure was transposed from [[Goslar]] municipal law.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisnensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meissen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against [[Frederick the Brave]] of Meissen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margraves of Meissen, who held the city until 1918.

In 1455, Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meissen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke William that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446–1451) between the two brothers ([[Saxon Brother War|''Bruderkrieg'']]).
In the [[Treaty of Leipzig|second division]] of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernest, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia and its dynasty, the Ernestine Wettins.

=== Early modern period ===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Altenburg quite early, in 1522, by [[George Spalatin]], Wenzeslaus Linck and [[Gabriel Zwilling]]. During the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustinian monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] brought defeat for the Ernestines, Altenburg belonged to the Albertines for short time (1547–1554) before coming back to the Ernestines after the Naumburg Treaty.

From 1603 to 1672, Altenburg was the residence of an Ernestine line, after that, it fell to [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] brought heavy damage to the city and more than half of the population died.

During the [[Napoleonic wars]] it was a scene of a brief Allied [[Raid at Altenburg|raid]] by the Saxon General [[Johann von Thielmann]].

=== Since 1815 ===
[[File:Saxonia Museum fuer saechsische Vaterlandskunde IV 24.jpg|thumb|Market square in 1839]]
When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], successor state to the dissolved [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Around 1830, the city walls and gates were knocked down and the old suburbia in front of the former wall were incorporated. Industrialization began around this time and the economy and population both saw rapid growth, strengthened by the connection to the railway in 1842 (as Thuringia's first connected city). The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] led to the abdication of the conservative duke [[Joseph, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|Joseph]], who was replaced by his more liberal brother [[Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg|George]]. The last duke abdicated during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918]] on 13 November 1918 after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state of Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.

Altenburg was a working-class city during the [[Weimar Republic]], ruled by [[SPD]] and [[KPD]], which led to heavy conflicts between left- and right-wing forces after 1933. The Jewish community was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, many Jews emigrated or were killed in the concentration camps. Furthermore, communists and invalids from Altenburg were murdered. During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided 13,000 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] for [[Hugo Schneider AG|HASAG]], the third largest German company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The US Army reached Altenburg on 15 April 1945 and was replaced by the Soviet Army on 1 July 1945.

In 1952, Thuringia was dissolved and replaced by [[Administrative divisions of East Germany| administrative divisions of East Germany (Bezirks)]]. Altenburg became part of the [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig administrative district]], in which it was the second largest city. After reunification, previously extant states were re-established in the former east Germany as federal states in the reunified Germany. Although a majority of 54% in the district voted for [[Saxony]] in a plebiscite, the district council decided to join Thuringia together with the [[Schmölln]] district, partly because a vast majority of 80% in the neighboring Schmölln district had voted for Thuringia. These districts had formed the eastern part of Saxe-Altenburg until 1920 and were reunified as the modern-day [[Altenburger Land]] district in 1994.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Altenburg Brücke zur Insel im Großen Teich Foto 2006 Wolfgang Pehlemann Wiesbaden PICT0300.jpg|thumb|&quot;Großer Teich&quot;, bridge to island with the Zoological Gardens]]
Altenburg is located on the southern edge of the [[Leipzig Bay]], a flat and fertile area, with intensive agricultural use and [[lignite]] surface mining {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the town. The nearest mountains are the [[Ore Mountains]] approximately {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south-east. The [[Pleiße]] valley runs east of the city, whereas the center itself is located at ''Blaue Flut'' (blue flood) river, a small tributary of Pleiße river. The Blaue Flut feeds the ''Großer Teich'' (big pond), an inner-city pond with an island in the middle, on which the Altenburg zoo is located. There is relatinely little forest within the town's municipal territory: the small ''Stadtwald'' (town wood) and ''Herzog-Ernst-Wald'' (Duke Ernest wood) south of the center and the ''Fasanerieholz'' (Pheasantry wood) at Ehrenberg district. The elevation of the city center is 200 m, to the north it declines down to 162 m and in the south next to Mockzig district it rises up to 261 m.

=== Administrative division ===
Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren, Thuringia|Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Meuselwitz]], [[Treben]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

Because of the quite densely settlement of the region, many small villages and ancient former suburbs are situated within the municipal territory, which is officially divided into 4 districts:
* Altenburg (including the villages Drescha, Kauerndorf, Poschwitz, Rasephas, Steinwitz and Zschernitzsch) 
* Ehrenberg, incorporated in 1993 (with Greipzig, Lehnitzsch, Mockzig, Modelwitz, Paditz, Stünzhain, Zschaiga and Zschechwitz)
* Kosma, incorporated in 1996 (with Altendorf and Kürbitz)
* Zetzscha, incorporated in 1994 (with Knau, Oberzetzscha, Rautenberg and Unterzetzscha)

=== Demographics ===
[[File:Altenburg Population Statistics.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of population between 1831 and 2011]]
Altenburg has been a relatively big town (compared to others in the wider region) down the centuries, because of its importance as a [[Kaiserpfalz]] and later as a ducal residence. During the Middle Ages, it had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants, rising to 6,000 around 1700, 10,000 around 1800 and 20,000 around 1870, making it Thuringia's second-largest city after [[Erfurt]] for a short time in the mid-19th century. The population grew further to 40,000 in 1910, 44,000 in 1940 and peaked at about 56,000 around 1980 before starting to decline. In 1988, before reunification, Altenburg had 53,000 inhabitants, shrinking to 41,000by 2000 and 33,000 in 2012. With a decline of nearly 40% since 1988, Altenburg is among the most rapidly decling urban areas in Germany.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 1.27% p.a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Altenburg. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders, others are [[Windischleuba]] and [[Nobitz]]. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Altenburg to search a better life in western Germany or other major east German cities like [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] or [[Jena]]. The birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because there is no immigration to compensate it. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 16% (according to 2011 EU census), which is the largest amount among Thuringia's major towns. A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Altenburg has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 282 in 2012, this is -8.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was -1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important target regions of Altenburg migrants are the large cities around like Leipzig, Dresden, Halle, Jena and Erfurt, as well as the western German conurbations.

Like most other small to middling eastern German towns, Altenburg has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.7% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 1.6% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Altenburg are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]] and [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved a bit: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 24% in 2005 to 10% in 2013 with little bit higher rates in the city than in the other municipalities of the Altenburger Land district. Nevertheless, this is still one of the highest rates in Thuringia.

Partly due to official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 12.1% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.5% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Culture ===
Altenburg is nicknamed ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]]. Because of the influence Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had on the town, it is nicknamed a &quot;[[Barbarossa town]]&quot;.

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Altenburg: 
* The ''Schloss- und Spielkartenmuseum'' (castle and playing card museum) inside the castle hosts an exhibition about Altenburg as a ducal residence, and a historical playing cards collection. 
* The ''[[Lindenau-Museum]]'' (established in 1876) shows [[Bernhard von Lindenau]]'s art collection including [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th–15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.  
* The ''Mauritianum'' (opened in 1908) is Altenburg's museum of natural history with the largest well-known mummified [[Rat king (folklore)|rat king]], which was found in 1828 in a miller's fireplace at Buchheim. 
* The ''Brauereimuseum'' inside the Altenburger brewery shows an exhibition about beer and its history with a local focus.

=== Old town ===
[[File:AltenburgWall35.JPG|thumb|Some Gründerzeit architecture at Wallstraße]]
The town center of Altenburg within the former wall has a planned grid of 12th/13th century origin, whereas the two old settlement cores were located around ''Brühl'' in the north-east and around St. Nicholas' Church in the south-west. The area around the castle and southward on the eastern bank of Blaue Flut river has also been urban since the Middle Ages, nevertheless, it was located outside the city walls.

During the 19th and early 20th century, Altenburg saw a construction boom and the town enlarged to all directions, particularly north and east towards the new railway station (opened in 1878). Its time as a state capital until 1918 led to many interesting public and private buildings in [[Gründerzeit]] style, same as in other historist styles. Later, the town lost some of its importance and became a simple district capital in Thuringia. World War II left Altenburg unscathed, so all historic buildings are preserved. Nevertheless, the buildings' maintenance was neglected during the [[East German]] period, instead, some big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were set up on the northern and south-eastern periphery of Altenburg.

After reunification, most of the main sights and historic buildings were refurbished. On the other hand, the city lost much of its population which led to a very high vacancy rate, especially in the old inner-city buildings, which today endangers the historic city structure because of many vacant old private houses.

* Altenburg Castle is the big ducal residence on a hill above the city center. It was in use first as fortification and later as residence since the 9th century until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Today's castle is of 17th and 18th century origin and was built in Renaissance, later in Baroque style. The chapel is of older origin (see above). The castle is the scene of the famous ''[[Prinzenraub]]'', related by [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Gumpert Apollo Dubai.jpg|thumb|Gumpert Apollo]]
Agriculture plays an important role in the region, because the [[Loess]] soil around the city is very fertile. 69% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use, both for cultivation and cattle farming. A famous product of the region is [[Altenburger Ziegenkäse]], a soft cheese of goat milk with some [[caraway]] seed inside with protected [[Geographical indication]]. Another typical dish of Altenburg is [[Mutzbraten]], a flame-grilled pork speciality. Altenburg is also known for its mustard, which is produced by Altenburger Senf und Feinkost. Altenburger beer also enjoys some popularity.

The industry of Altenburg was based on the production of textiles and hardware during the 19th and 20th century, but most of the companies did not survive the transition to capitalism after German reunification. Altenburg was especially known for its sewing machine production from companies like ''Vesta''. Today, the main branches are food industries (with a factory of [[Vion NV]] amongst others) and engineering with car component production in focus. The [[Gumpert|Gumpert Sportwagenmanufaktur]] produced the [[Gumpert Apollo]] supercar between 2005 and its bankruptcy in 2013. Altenburg is also noted for produced playing cards. The Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik (playing card factory) was founded in 1831; today it is a subsidiary company of [[Cartamundi]] and market leader in Germany. In 2012, there were 19 companies with more than 20 workers in industrial sector, employing 1,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €451 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?GGglied=1&amp;GGTabelle=lk&amp;GGTabelle=gem&amp;GGTabelle=erf&amp;GGTabelle=vg&amp;tabelle=gg000602%7C%7CJahresdaten+nach+Gemeinden%2C+erf%FCllenden+Gemeinden+und+Verwaltungsgemeinschaften+%28WZ+2008%29+im+Bergbau+und+Verarbeitenden+Gewerbe+%2820+und+mehr+Besch%E4ftigte%29+ab+2009&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-3&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99  According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

Altenburg is a regional service hub for retail, hospitals, government, culture etc. Tourism doesn't play a big role, although the city hosts many historic sights and is a local center of culture with theater and museums. In 2012, 37,000 hotel guests had 87,000 overnight stays in Altenburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=ge000802%7C%7CAnk%FCnfte%2C+%DCbernachtungen+und+Aufenthaltsdauer+der+G%E4ste+in+Beherbergungsst%E4tten+nach+ausgew%E4hlten+Gemeinden+%28ohne+Camping%29&amp;startpage=77&amp;csv=&amp;richtung=&amp;sortiere=&amp;vorspalte=0&amp;tit2=&amp;TIS=&amp;SZDT=&amp;anzahlH=-1&amp;fontgr=12&amp;mkro=&amp;AnzeigeAuswahl=&amp;XLS=&amp;auswahlNr=&amp;felder=0&amp;felder=1&amp;felder=2&amp;felder=3&amp;felder=4&amp;felder=5&amp;zeit=2012%7C%7C99 According to Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
[[File:Altenburg - train station 2009 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|Altenburg station]]
Altenburg was the first city in Thuringia with connection to the railway, established in 1842 with the [[Leipzig–Hof railway|Leipzig–Hof line]]. Initially, [[Altenburg station]] was a terminus station, which became impractical as traffic grew, so a new through station was built in 1878 in the north-east of the city. In addition to the connections to [[Leipzig]] (1842) and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]]/[[Zwickau]] (1844), some more lines were established to [[Glauchau]] (1858, via [[Gößnitz]]), to [[Gera]] (1865, via Gößnitz), to [[Zeitz]] (1872, abandoned in 2002) and to [[Narsdorf]] (1901, abandoned in 1998). Today, the Altenburg station is the only station within the municipality, after the Paditz station (on the Hof line) and the North Altenburg station (on the Zeitz line) were closed. There are some regional trains to [[Leipzig]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Erfurt]] (via [[Gera]] and [[Jena]]) today. [[Glauchau]] can be reached by changing trains in the near [[Gößnitz]] station. With the rollout of the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]] in December 2013, the services on the Leipzig–Hof/Zwickau line were reorganized and integrated in the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] with connections to Leipzig twice an hour. The connection to long-distance trains is carried out via Leipzig (north and east), Jena (south) and Erfurt (west), since the last long-distance trains on the Leipzig–Hof line ceased operating in 2006.

Altenburg is situated between two [[Autobahn]]s: the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] ([[Erfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} south and the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] ([[Leipzig]]–[[Chemnitz]]) passes approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city. Regional traffic is carried by the three [[Bundesstraße|national roads]]n in Altenburg. The [[Bundesstraße 7|B7]] is the connection to [[Gera]] (and A4 in Erfurt direction) in the south-west and to [[Rochlitz]] in the north-east, the [[Bundesstraße 93|B93]] runs to [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] (and A72 in Leipzig direction) in the north and to [[Zwickau]] in the south and the [[Bundesstraße 180|B180]] links Altenburg with [[Zeitz]] in the west and [[Hohenstein-Ernstthal]] (and A72/A4 in Chemnitz and Dresden direction via secondary road 1357) in the south-east. An important secondary road connects Altenburg with Gera north to the B7 via [[Lumpzig]].

[[File:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]]
The [[Leipzig-Altenburg Airport]], a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military airport, is situated {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the city and was used by [[Ryanair]] for flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]], Barcelona-[[Girona]] and [[Edinburgh]] until 2011. Currently, there are no public flights at this airport. The next regional airport is located in [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] ({{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north).

Biking is becoming more popular since the construction of long distance cycle tracks began in the 1990s. Both the ''Pleiße track'', along the [[Pleiße]] valley from [[Werdau]] near Zwickau to [[Leipzig]], and the ''Thuringian city track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)'' from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and [[Gera]] to Altenburg, connect points of tourist interest.

Local public transport within Altenburg is based exclusively on buses. Six lines connect the outlying quarters to the inner city. Furthermore, there are some regional bus services to the villages in the district. The Altenburg Tramway was in operation from 1895 until 1920.
