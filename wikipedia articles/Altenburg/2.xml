'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.


==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
[[Image:Joseph Karl Stieler 001.jpg|thumb|Duke Joseph of Saxe-Altenburg (1847)]]
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

==Economy==
[[image:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Altenburg-Nobitz Airport]]

Altenburg is called the ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]].
The [[Altenburg-Nobitz Airport|Airport of Altenburg Nobitz]], a former [[Russia]]n airstrip, is used for cheap commercial flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]] and [[Podgorica]].

==Sights==
Altenburg's [[town hall]] is one of the most important [[Renaissance]] buildings in Germany. It was built between [[1562]] and [[1564]] by the [[architect]] [[Nikolaus Grohmann]]. The ''Schenkendorffsches Palais'' ([[1724]]) and the ''Alte Amtshaus'' (1725) are remarkable [[Baroque]] structure. There is also a [[castle]], which is the scene of the famous &quot;[[Prinzenraub]]&quot;, related by [[Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. The Western main wing ([[1706]]-[[1732]]) contains an exhibition on the history of playing cards and card games and a historical museum.
The Lindenau Museum in the palace of [[Bernhard August von Lindenau]] ([[1799]]-[[1854]]), built in [[1875]] houses [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the [[13th century|13th]]-[[15th century|15th]] centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.


==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
[[Image:Joseph Karl Stieler 001.jpg|thumb|Duke Joseph of Saxe-Altenburg (1847)]]
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]].

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.


==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.
[[Image:Joseph Karl Stieler 001.jpg|thumb|Duke Joseph of Saxe-Altenburg (1847)]]
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

==Culture ==
Altenburg is called the ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]].

==Economy==
The [[supercar]] [[Gumpert Apollo]] is produced in Altenburg.

==Transport==
[[image:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Altenburg-Nobitz Airport]]
In the vicinity of the city are two airports. The [[Altenburg-Nobitz Airport|Airport of Altenburg Nobitz]], a former [[Russia]]n airstrip, is used for cheap commercial flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]] and [[Girona]].
[[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] is a internatinal airport 60 km northwest of Altenburg.

==Sights==
Altenburg's [[town hall]] is one of the most important [[Renaissance]] buildings in Germany. It was built between 1562 and 1564 by the architect [[Nikolaus Grohmann]]. The ''Schenkendorffsches Palais'' (1724) and the ''Alte Amtshaus'' (1725) are remarkable [[Baroque]] structure. There is also a [[castle]], which is the scene of the famous &quot;[[Prinzenraub]]&quot;, related by [[Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. The Western main wing (1706-1732) contains an exhibition on the history of playing cards and card games and a historical museum.
The Lindenau Museum in the palace of [[Bernhard August von Lindenau]] (1799-1854), built in 1875 houses [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

==Culture ==
Altenburg is called the ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]].

==Economy==
The [[supercar]] [[Gumpert Apollo]] is produced in Altenburg.

==Transport==
[[image:AOC-Terminal and Tower.jpg|thumb|Altenburg-Nobitz Airport]]
In the vicinity of the city are two airports. The [[Altenburg-Nobitz Airport|Airport of Altenburg Nobitz]], a former [[Russia]]n airstrip, is used for cheap commercial flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]] and [[Girona]].
[[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle]] is a internatinal airport 60 km northwest of Altenburg.

==Sights==
Altenburg's [[town hall]] is one of the most important [[Renaissance]] buildings in Germany. It was built between 1562 and 1564 by the architect [[Nikolaus Grohmann]]. The ''Schenkendorffsches Palais'' (1724) and the ''Alte Amtshaus'' (1725) are remarkable [[Baroque]] structure. There is also a [[castle]], which is the scene of the famous &quot;[[Prinzenraub]]&quot;, related by [[Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. The Western main wing (1706-1732) contains an exhibition on the history of playing cards and card games and a historical museum.
The Lindenau Museum in the palace of [[Bernhard August von Lindenau]] (1799-1854), built in 1875 houses [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the 13th-15th centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]].

From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.
[[Image:Joseph Karl Stieler 001.jpg|thumb|Duke Joseph of Saxe-Altenburg (1847)]]
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] und [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[County palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
 
During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided [[slave labour]] for [[HASAG]], the third largest Germany company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'' www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of % 20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
 
During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided [[slave labour]] for [[HASAG]], the third largest Germany company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'' www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of % 20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]].

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg ist bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
 
During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided [[slave labour]] for [[HASAG]], the third largest Germany company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'' www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of % 20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
 
During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided [[slave labour]] for [[HASAG]], the third largest Germany company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'' www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of % 20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
 
During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided [[slave labour]] for [[HASAG]], the third largest Germany company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor.''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'' www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of % 20 camps. htm&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

==Sights==
Altenburg's [[town hall]] is one of the most important [[Renaissance]] buildings in Germany. It was built between 1562 and 1564 by the architect [[Nikolaus Grohmann]]. The ''Schenkendorffsches Palais'' (1724) and the ''Alte Amtshaus'' (1725) are remarkable [[Baroque]] structure. There is also a [[castle]], which is the scene of the famous &quot;[[Prinzenraub]]&quot;, related by [[Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. The Western main wing (1706-1732) contains an exhibition on the history of playing cards and card games and a historical museum.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

[[Image:Altenburg-1650-Merian.jpg|thumb|300px|Altenburg about the year 1650]]

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
 
During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided [[slave labour]] for [[HASAG]], the third largest Germany company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

In 1455 Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on 13 November [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
 
During [[World War II]], several subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] were located here. They provided [[slave labour]] for [[HASAG]], the third largest Germany company to use concentration camp labour.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor,  [http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'']&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Close to Altenburg, near Ehrenberg is a large stone which the devil used as a hat, boasting that even Jesus was not strong enough to do this. Jesus appeared and lifted the stone with one finger. The stone now bears the imprint of both the devil's head and Christ's finger.

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.

==Boundaries==

Altenburg is bounded by [[Windischleuba]], [[Nobitz]], [[Saara]], [[Altkirchen]], [[Göhren]], [[Lödla]], [[Rositz]], [[Wintersdorf]] and [[Gerstenberg]].

==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area ([[Osterland]]) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.
[[Image:Altenburg Rote Spitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Rote Spitzen]]
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The 11th century ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[Count palatine|palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of Thuringia. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.
