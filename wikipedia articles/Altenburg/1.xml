It is the [[capital]] of the [[Altenburger Land]] [[district]].
===history===
The town (civitas Altenburg) is first mentioned in 976 in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]]. Remains of a Slavonic castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavonic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by Henry I. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by Slavs.

The location on the imperial road between [[Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] (salt-trade) gave Altenburg some economic importance.
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[battle of Hohenmölsen]] between Henry IV and Rudolph of Suevia. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. An 11th century tower (Mantelturm) is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial palatinate-castel and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the Stauffer emperors promoted Altenburg. It became a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, the lands of the Groitzsch-family bought by Friedrich Barbarossa, Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg andd Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of [[Leipzig]] held by the Margrave of [[Meißen]].
Under Friedrich Barbarossa a lot of building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew. A Augustine priory was founded, the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (Rote Spitzen) are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.
During the interregium, the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by Rudolph of Hapsburg, who aspired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz Altenburg was part of the anti-Missnian Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King Albrecht I lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

1455 Altenburg saw the division of the Meißen lands between Electorate Friedrich (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm (Altenburger Teilung) that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (Hallescher Machtspruch) to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (Bruderkrieg).
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between Ernst and Albrecht at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernst, together with the Electorate (Kurland), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the peasant uprising of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four insurgent peasants were executed on the marketplace

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxony-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of Saxony-Altenburg. The last duke abdicated at the 13. November 1918 after being promised 12 Million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxony-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District. In 1990, it became part of Thuringia again.

It is the [[capital]] of the [[Altenburger Land]] [[district]].
===History===
The town (civitas Altenburg) is first mentioned in 976 in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]]. Remains of a Slavonic castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavonic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by Henry I. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by Slavs.

The location on the imperial road between [[Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] (salt-trade) gave Altenburg some economic importance.
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[battle of Hohenmölsen]] between Henry IV and Rudolph of Suevia. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. An 11th century tower (Mantelturm) is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial palatinate-castel and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the Stauffer emperors promoted Altenburg. It became a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, the lands of the Groitzsch-family bought by Friedrich Barbarossa, Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg andd Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of [[Leipzig]] held by the Margrave of [[Meißen]].
Under Friedrich Barbarossa a lot of building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew. A Augustine priory was founded, the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (Rote Spitzen) are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.
During the interregium, the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by Rudolph of Hapsburg, who aspired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz Altenburg was part of the anti-Missnian Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King Albrecht I lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

1455 Altenburg saw the division of the Meißen lands between Electorate Friedrich (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm (Altenburger Teilung) that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (Hallescher Machtspruch) to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (Bruderkrieg).
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between Ernst and Albrecht at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernst, together with the Electorate (Kurland), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the peasant uprising of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four insurgent peasants were executed on the marketplace

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxony-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of Saxony-Altenburg. The last duke abdicated at the 13. November 1918 after being promised 12 Million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxony-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District. In 1990, it became part of Thuringia again.

Altenburg's [[town hall]] is one of the most important [[Renaissance]] buildings in Germany. It was built between [[1562]] and [[1564]] by the [[architect]] [[Nikolaus Grohmann]].

As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by Slavs.

The location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] (salt-trade) gave Altenburg some economic importance.
The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[battle of Hohenmölsen]] between Henry IV and Rudolph of Suevia. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. An 11th century tower (Mantelturm) is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial palatinate-castel and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the 12th century, the Stauffer emperors promoted Altenburg. It became a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, the lands of the Groitzsch-family bought by Friedrich Barbarossa, Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg andd Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of [[Leipzig]] held by the Margrave of [[Meißen]].
Under Friedrich Barbarossa a lot of building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew. A Augustine priory was founded, the church was finished in 1172. The twin towers (Rote Spitzen) are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the 12th century.
During the interregium, the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by Rudolph of Hapsburg, who aspired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz Altenburg was part of the anti-Missnian Pleiße-city Union of 1290. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] 1307 against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King Albrecht I lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

1455 Altenburg saw the division of the Meißen lands between Electorate Friedrich (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm (Altenburger Teilung) that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (Hallescher Machtspruch) to a war (1446-1451) between the two brothers (Bruderkrieg).
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between Ernst and Albrecht at Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernst, together with the Electorate (Kurland), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the peasant uprising of 1525, the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four insurgent peasants were executed on the marketplace

From 1603-1672 Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxony-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in 1826, Altenburg became the capital of Saxony-Altenburg. The last duke abdicated at the 13. November 1918 after being promised 12 Million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxony-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in 1920.
In 1952, Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District. In 1990, it became part of Thuringia again.

It is the [[capital]] of the [[Altenburger Land]] [[district]].
===History===
The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry_the_Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry_IV%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf_von_Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of [[Leipzig]] held by the Margrave of [[Meißen]].
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with [[Zwickau]] and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert_I_of_Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest%2C_Elector_of_Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert%2C_Duke_of_Saxony|Albert]] at [[Leipzig]] in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxony-[[Gotha]]-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of Saxony-Altenburg. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxony-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with [[Zwickau]] and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at [[Leipzig]] in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxony-[[Gotha]]-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of Saxony-Altenburg. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxony-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

===History of Altenburg/Thuringia===
The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis.

It is the [[capital]] of the [[Altenburger Land]] [[district]].

Other towns named &quot;Altenburg&quot; are listed in [[:de:Altenburg (Begriffsklärung)|de:Altenburg]]:

* 3 in [[Austria]], 2 in [[South Tyrol]]
* 2 in [[Switzerland]]
* 1 in [[Czechia|Czech Republic]], and furthermore
* 2 [[castle]]s in [[Germany]] and a [[monastery]] in Austria.

==History of Altenburg/Thuringia==
The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of [[Leipzig]] held by the Margrave of [[Meißen]].
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with [[Zwickau]] and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at [[Leipzig]] in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxony-[[Gotha]]-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of Saxony-Altenburg.

==History of Altenburg/Thuringia==
[[Image:Altenburg Castle.jpg|thumb|View of Schloß Altenburg]]
[[Image:The courtyard of Altenburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of Schloß Altenburg]]
The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of [[Leipzig]] held by the Margrave of [[Meißen]].
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with [[Zwickau]] and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at [[Leipzig]] in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxony-[[Gotha]]-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of Saxony-Altenburg. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxony-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

'''Altenburg''' is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.


==History==
The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

'''Altenburg''' is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.


==History==
The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
[[Image:Joseph Karl Stieler 001.jpg|thumb|left|Duke Joseph of Saxe-Altenburg (1847) ]]
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.


==History==
The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].
[[Image:Joseph Karl Stieler 001.jpg|thumb|left|Duke Joseph of Saxe-Altenburg (1847) ]]
During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]].

'''Altenburg''' {{Audio|Altenburg.ogg|''[listen]''}} is a town in the [[States of Germany|German federal state]] (''Bundesland'') of [[Thuringia]], 45 km south of [[Leipzig]]. It is the capital of the [[Altenburger Land]] district.


==History==

The town (civitas Altenburg) was first mentioned in a deed to the bishop of [[Zeitz]] in [[976]]. Remains of a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] castle on the Schloßberg demonstrate that the town was probably a Slavic foundation, the capital of the shire of Plisni, taken over during the conquest of [[Meißen]] by [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]]. As shown by place names, the surrounding area (Osterland) was mainly settled by [[Slavs]].

The town's location on the imperial road between [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Cheb]] in [[Bohemia]] gave Altenburg economic importance in the salt trade.

The first castle, located under the present day church St. Bartholomäi, was destroyed after the [[Battle of Hohenmölsen]] between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and [[Rudolf von Rheinfeld|Rudolph of Swabia]]. It was rebuilt on the Schloßberg outside of the town. The [[11th century]] ''Mantelturm'' tower is still preserved. The castle later became an imperial [[palatinate]] and played an important part in the German takeover and settlement of the area between the [[Harz]]-mountains and the [[Elbe]].

In the middle of the [[12th century]], the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors patronized Altenburg, allowing the town to become a market and a mint. Together with the Royal forests Leina, Pahna, Kammerforst and Luckauer Forst, lands of the Groitzsch family bought by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], Altenburg, [[Colditz]], [[Zwickau]] and [[Chemnitz]] were turned into the Terra Plisniensis. Altenburg and Chemnitz as Imperial towns were intended to reduce the importance of Leipzig held by the Margrave of Meißen.
Under Frederick Barbarossa much building took place, especially in the market area, and the town grew rapidly. An [[Augustinians|Augustine]] priory was founded and the church was finished in [[1172]]. The twin towers (''Rote Spitzen'') are still preserved. A town wall was constructed at the end of the [[12th century]].

During the [[Interregnum]], the Terra Plisniensis was impounded, but bought back by [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who desired the crown of [[Thuringia]]. Together with Zwickau and Chemnitz, Altenburg was part of the anti-Meißen Pleiße-city Union of [[1290]]. After the [[Battle of Lucka]] in [[1307]] against Friedrich (der Freidige) of Meißen and his brother Diezmann, King [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert I]] lost Altenburg and the Pleiße-lands to the margraves of Meißen.

In [[1455]] Altenburg saw the division (''Altenburger Teilung'') of the Meißen lands between Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II]] (the Gentle) and Duke Wilhelm that led, after a failed attempt at reconciliation (''Hallescher Machtspruch'') to a war ([[1446]]-[[1451]]) between the two brothers (''Bruderkrieg'').
In the second division of the [[Wettin]] lands between [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]] at Leipzig in [[1485]], Altenburg fell to Erenst, together with the Electorate (''Kurland''), [[Grimma]], the Mutschener Pflege, [[Leisnig]], Thuringia and the [[Vogtland]]. From this time on, Altenburg was historically connected with Thuringia.
During the [[Peasants' War]] of [[1525]], the Altenburg Augustine monastery was attacked. In the summer, four peasant rebels were executed at the marketplace.

From [[1603]]-[[1672]] Altenburg was the residence of the Ernestine line, after that, it fell to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. When the Ernestine lands were re-divided in [[1826]], Altenburg became the capital of [[Saxe-Altenburg]]. The last duke abdicated on [[13 November]] [[1918]] after being promised 12 million Marks and the ownership of numerous castles. The free-state Saxe-Altenburg was merged with Thuringia in [[1920]].
In [[1952]], Altenburg fell to the Leipzig District, but became part of Thuringia again in [[1990]].

==Economy==

Altenburg is called the ''playing cards town''. The game of [[Skat]] is said to have originated here, based on the Bavarian [[tarock]].
The [[Altenburg-Nobitz Airport|Airport of Altenburg Nobitz]], a former [[Russia]]n airstrip, is used for cheap commercial flights to [[London Stansted Airport|London Stansted]] and [[Podgorica]].

==Sights==
Altenburg's [[town hall]] is one of the most important [[Renaissance]] buildings in Germany. It was built between [[1562]] and [[1564]] by the [[architect]] [[Nikolaus Grohmann]]. The ''Schenkendorffsches Palais'' ([[1724]]) and the ''Alte Amtshaus'' (1725) are remarkable [[Baroque]] structure. There is also a [[castle]], which is the scene of the famous &quot;[[Prinzenraub]]&quot;, related by [[Carlyle]] in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. The Western main wing ([[1706]]-[[1732]]) contains an exhibition on the history of playing cards and card games and a historical museum.
The Lindenau Museum in the palace of [[Bernhard August von Lindenau]] ([[1799]]-[[1854]]), built in [[1875]] houses [[Italian culture|Italian]] paintings of the [[13th century|13th]]-[[15th century|15th]] centuries, a collection of classical antiquities and cast and modern art.
