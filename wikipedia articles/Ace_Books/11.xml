'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].

Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973. These have proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Guardian|title=William Burroughs' opposite number: Maurice Helbrant|date=February 18, 2014|author=Jordison, Sam|quote=Readers of the first printed version of the novel didn't have far to look if their curiosity about Burroughs' adversaries was aroused.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]]; its editorial team is also responsible for the [[Roc Books]] imprint, although the two imprints maintain a separate identity.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfcanada.ca/winter2005/johnmorganinterview.htm | title = SF Canada Article – &quot;An Interview with Editor John Morgan&quot; by Celu Amberstone| accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | pages= 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953 to 1963: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964 to 1970: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971 to 2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].

Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973. These have proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Guardian|title=William Burroughs' opposite number: Maurice Helbrant|date=February 18, 2014|author=Jordison, Sam|quote=Readers of the first printed version of the novel didn't have far to look if their curiosity about Burroughs' adversaries was aroused.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]]; its editorial team is also responsible for the [[Roc Books]] imprint, although the two imprints maintain a separate identity.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfcanada.ca/winter2005/johnmorganinterview.htm | title = SF Canada Article – &quot;An Interview with Editor John Morgan&quot; by Celu Amberstone| accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | pages= 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].

Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973. These have proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Guardian|title=William Burroughs' opposite number: Maurice Helbrant|date=February 18, 2014|author=Jordison, Sam|quote=Readers of the first printed version of the novel didn't have far to look if their curiosity about Burroughs' adversaries was aroused.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]]; its editorial team is also responsible for the [[Roc Books]] imprint, although the two imprints maintain a separate identity.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfcanada.ca/winter2005/johnmorganinterview.htm | title = SF Canada Article – &quot;An Interview with Editor John Morgan&quot; by Celu Amberstone| accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.

Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A.

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].

Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973. These have proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Guardian|title=William Burroughs' opposite number: Maurice Helbrant|date=February 18, 2014|author=Jordison, Sam|quote=Readers of the first printed version of the novel didn't have far to look if their curiosity about Burroughs' adversaries was aroused.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]]; its editorial team is also responsible for the [[Roc Books]] imprint, although the two imprints maintain a separate identity.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfcanada.ca/winter2005/johnmorganinterview.htm | title = SF Canada Article – &quot;An Interview with Editor John Morgan&quot; by Celu Amberstone| accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | pages= 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Corrick| first= James A.| authorlink= James A. Corrick| title= Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double| year= 1989 | publisher= Gryphon Books| location= New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3 | pages= 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Edwards|first = Malcolm|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include [[Tom Doherty]], who left to start [[Tor Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Tor Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/tor_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Langford|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jim Baen]], who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded [[Baen Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Baen, Jim : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/baen_jim|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Clute|first = John|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers who have worked at Ace include [[Frederik Pohl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.  As of December 2012, recently published authors included [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Charles Stross]], [[Laurell K.

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = sf-encyclopedia.com|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H.

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Prior to 1968, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K.

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Edwards|first = Malcolm|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include [[Tom Doherty]], who left to start [[Tor Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Tor Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/tor_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Langford|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jim Baen]], who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded [[Baen Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Baen, Jim : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/baen_jim|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Clute|first = John|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers who have worked at Ace include [[Frederik Pohl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.  As of December 2012, recently published authors included [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Charles Stross]], [[Laurell K.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Edwards|first = Malcolm|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include [[Tom Doherty]], who left to start [[Tor Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Tor Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/tor_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Langford|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jim Baen]], who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded [[Baen Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Baen, Jim : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/baen_jim|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Clute|first = John|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers who have worked at Ace include [[Frederik Pohl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.  As of December 2012, recently published authors included [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Charles Stross]], [[Laurell K.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.

Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications Inc., which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R.

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.  As of December 2012, recently published authors included [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Charles Stross]], [[Laurell K.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Edwards|first = Malcolm|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include [[Tom Doherty]], who left to start [[Tor Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Tor Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/tor_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Langford|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jim Baen]], who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded [[Baen Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Baen, Jim : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/baen_jim|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Clute|first = John|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers who have worked at Ace include [[Frederik Pohl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''.

Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A.

Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff.

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Reynolds, Pat| year=2004| title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text | url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html | accessdate =May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Pat |year=2004 |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |accessdate=May 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022929/http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |archivedate=September  8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K.

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Pat |year=2004 |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |accessdate=May 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022929/http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |archivedate=September  8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

In 1996, [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]] acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint.  As of December 2012, recently published authors included [[Joe Haldeman]], [[Charles Stross]], [[Laurell K.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. ISBN 0-9673639-5-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Pat |year=2004 |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |accessdate=May 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022929/http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |archivedate=September  8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 2| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1978|isbn=0-911682-22-8 | page = 471}}&lt;/ref&gt; His magazines included ''Ace Mystery'' and ''Ace Sports'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html | title = Magazine Data File|accessdate =May 11, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430181533/http://www.philsp.com/data/data002.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K. Hall &amp; Co.|year = 1982|isbn = 0-8161-8590-5|location = Boston|pages = 1–14|editor-last = Cnider|editor-first = Allen Billy|chapter = Ace Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''tête-bêche'' book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9673639-5-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]].

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

'''Ace Books''' is an American specialty publisher of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by [[A. A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] and began as a genre publisher of [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[western (genre)|westerns]]. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] novels, media [[tie-in]] [[novelizations]], and [[romance novel|romances]].  Ace became known for the ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'' binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound ''tête-bêche'', until 1973.

Ace, along with [[Ballantine Books]], was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, [[Donald A. Wollheim]] and [[Terry Carr]], left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]]. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] series, for which Carr was the editor. Further [[mergers and acquisitions]] resulted in the company becoming a part of [[Berkley Books]]. Ace then became an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Penguin Group|Penguin Group (USA)]].

==History==

===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
[[File:AceD-36ConanCover.jpg|thumb|200px|Ace Double D-36, [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] the Conqueror''. The novel on the reverse side was [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Sword of Rhiannon''. Cover by [[Norman Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1087028 Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover)] from [[ISFDB]] Retrieved December 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Editor [[Donald A. Wollheim]] was working at [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Books]] in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade [[A. A. Wyn]] to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and [[pulp magazine]]s under the name [[A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers]].&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at [[Pyramid Books]]. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.&lt;ref name=Knight130&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight | authorlink= Damon Knight|title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound ''[[dos-à-dos binding#Tête-bêche|tête-bêche]]'': [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'', backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo'', priced at 35 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s, with serial number D-01.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features [[William S. Burroughs]]'s first novel, ''Junkie'' (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Harry Whittington (author)|Harry Whittington]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;&gt;Canja, Jeff. (2002) ''Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition'', East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9673639-5-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's ''Life with Lancelot'', backed with [[William Barton (writer)|William Barton]]'s ''Hunting on Kunderer'', issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than ''tête-bêche''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Corrick|first = James A.|title = Double Your Pleasure: the ACE SF Double|year = 1989|publisher = Gryphon Books|location = New York|isbn = 0-936071-13-3|pages = 12, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953–63: Genre specialization===
Ace's second title was a western (also ''tête-bêche''): [[William Colt MacDonald]]'s ''Bad Man's Return'', bound with [[J. Edward Leithead]]'s ''Bloody Hoofs''. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Quick Service]]'', bound with his ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. In 1953, [[A.E. van Vogt]]'s ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', bound with his ''The Universe Maker'', appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released [[Theodore S. Drachman]]'s ''Cry Plague!'', with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound with—[[Leslie Edgley]]'s ''The Judas Goat''—was not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid [[juvenile delinquent]] novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, ''The Young Wolves'' by Edward De Roo and D-378, ''Out For Kicks'' by Wilene Shaw.&lt;ref name = &quot;Canja_Collectable&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', were priced at 95 cents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; With [[Ballantine Books]], Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| page= 977| year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published—Ace published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as [[Philip K. Dick]] (''[[Solar Lottery]]'', 1955, D-103, bound with [[Leigh Brackett]]'s ''The Big Jump''); [[Gordon R. Dickson]] (''Alien from Arcturus'', 1956, D-139, bound with [[Nick Boddie Williams]]' ''The Atom Curtain''), [[Samuel R. Delany]] (''The Jewels of Aptor'', 1962, F-173, bound with [[James White (author)|James White]]'s ''Second Ending''), [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (''[[Rocannon's World]]'', 1966, G-574, bound with [[Avram Davidson]]'s ''The Kar-Chee Reign''), [[Roger Zelazny]] (''[[...And Call Me Conrad|This Immortal]]'', 1966, F-393),
and [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' (1968, H-54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Culture : Ace Books : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ace_books|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = July 26, 2015|last = Nicholls|first = Peter|last2 = Edwards|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964–70: Financial struggles===
[[File:AceRussChaosDiedCover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[And Chaos Died]]'' (1970), from the first [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace SF Special]] series. Cover by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]].]]

In 1964, science fiction author [[Terry Carr]] joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[R. A. Lafferty]], [[Joanna Russ]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Companion to Science Fiction|last = Latham|first = Rob|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 978-1-4051-1218-5|location = Malden, Massachusetts|pages = 210|chapter = The New Wave|editor-last = Seed|editor-first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' anthology series; and Carr also edited ''Universe'', a well-received original anthology series. ''Universe'' was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Authors : Carr, Terry : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|url = http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/carr_terry|website = Science Fiction Encyclopedia|accessdate = June 13, 2015|first = Malcolm|last = Edwards|last2 = Clute|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by [[Ballantine Books]] (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any &quot;unauthorized&quot; versions – referring directly to the Ace editions),&lt;ref name=Tolkien_Ballantine&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien|authorlink= J.R.R. Tolkien| title=The Lord of the Rings| publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year = 1965|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Pat |year=2004 |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |accessdate=May 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022929/http://www.tolkiensociety.com/tolkien/tale.html |archivedate=September 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|especially #270, #273 and #277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyn died in 1967,&lt;ref name=Tuck_Wyn /&gt; and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.&lt;ref name=Knight176&gt;{{cite book | first=Damon | last=Knight |authorlink= Damon Knight| title=The Futurians | publisher=John Day | location=New York | year=1977 | page = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with [[New American Library]],&lt;ref name=Knight176 /&gt; he proceeded to set up [[DAW Books]]. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, [[Charter Communications (publisher)|Charter Communications]], which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 [[Avenue of the Americas]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;, by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Ace was acquired by [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]]. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloom, Jeremy|year=1999|title=Chicon 2000:Editor Guest of Honor: Jim Baen|work=An Interview with the Editor Guest of Honor, Jim Baen|url=http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501200655/http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm|archivedate=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: History| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html|accessdate=May 10, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031910/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/history.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin-ace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us: Ace Books| url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html|accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060430032019/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/adult/ace.html| archivedate= April 30, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a [[freelancer|freelance]] editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=199|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Three Californias Trilogy|The Wild Shore]]'', [[Lucius Shepard]]'s ''Green Eyes'', and [[Michael Swanwick]]'s ''In the Drift''.

I will miss them all—but, since my job came out of my passion for the genre of science fiction and fantasy, I expect that I will be seeing them at conferences and conventions in the future}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=ABW12&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.us.penguingroup.com/pages/publishers/adult/ace.html | title =  Ace Books – Publishers – Penguin Group (USA) | accessdate = December 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214080310/http://www.us.penguingroup.com/pages/publishers/adult/ace.html|archivedate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicon.org/chi2000/card35.htm | title = Chicago in 2000: Ginjer Buchanan Card | accessdate =May 10, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050416162850/http://www.chicon.org/chi2000/card35.htm| archivedate = April 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science Fiction and Fantasy Published by Ace Books|last = Spelman|first = Dick|publisher = Institute for Specialized Literature|year = 1976|location = North Hollywood|pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D-series—35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series—25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series—40¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982|isbn=0-911682-26-0 | page = 715}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.
* F-series—40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series—45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series—50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series—various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series—60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series—75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series—95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in ''tête-bêche'' format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot for Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''. That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry'', but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., ''tête-bêche'') or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not ''tête-bêche'', although none of the ''tête-bêche'' titles have an S serial number.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.

The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Market Publishing in America|last = Kelley|first = George|publisher = G.K.
