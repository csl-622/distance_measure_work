A. Wyn. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

From its founding through to [[1971]] its editor in chief was [[Donald A. Wollheim]] who, in addition to publishing conventional paperbacks, also  instigated the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, printing two books together dos-a-dos (i. e., upside down with respect to one another so that there were two front covers and the two texts met in the middle, perhaps with a page or two of ads between them). Books by established authors were usually bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling 256 low-size pages), so that one or both would be cut to fit. The Ace Doubles format continued until the mid-[[1970s]].

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered what appeared to be a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition. Wollheim believed that this placed them outside of US copyright  [[law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. The legal row that erupted resulted in Ace being forced to pay compensation to Tolkien and paperback rights being assigned to [[Ballantine Books]]. It also gave Ace Books an enormous amount of free publicity, which Wollheim may have been counting on all along.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and initiated the Ace Science Fiction Specials line, publishing critically-acclaimed works by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]] and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to new authors.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

From its founding through to [[1971]] its editor in chief was [[Donald A. Wollheim]] who, in addition to publishing conventional paperbacks, also  instigated the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, printing two books together dos-a-dos (i. e., upside down with respect to one another so that there were two front covers and the two texts met in the middle, perhaps with a page or two of ads between them). Books by established authors were usually bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit. The Ace Doubles format continued until the mid-[[1970s]].

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US copyright  [[law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. The furore that erupted resulted in Ace agreeing to pay back-royalties Tolkien and withdrawing their edition.  Paperback rights were then assigned to [[Ballantine Books]]. It also gave Ace Books an enormous amount of free publicity, which Wollheim may have been counting on all along.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and initiated the Ace Science Fiction Specials line, publishing critically-acclaimed works by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]] and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to new authors. 

A few of its major authors have included:

* [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]], author of [[Neuromancer]]
* [[Laurell K. Hamilton]]
* [[Frank Herbert]], author of [[Dune (novel)|Dune]]
* [[Robert Heinlein]], author of [[Stranger in a Strange Land]]

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

From its founding through to [[1971]] its editor in chief was [[Donald A. Wollheim]] who, in addition to publishing conventional paperbacks, also  instigated the &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, printing two books together dos-a-dos (i. e., upside down with respect to one another so that there were two front covers and the two texts met in the middle, perhaps with a page or two of house ads between them). Books by established authors were usually bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit. The Ace Doubles format continued until the mid-[[1970s]].

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US copyright  [[law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the Ace Science Fiction Specials line, publishing critically-acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number. The letter series combined an indication of the price with a number that indicated sequence, as follows.  All date ranges are taken from [[Donald H. Tuck]]'s &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy Volume 3&quot; and so only cover the SF titles, and do not cover any dates past 1968.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1962.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1956.

For the D and S series titles, the number simply indicated sequence, and was assigned to either D or S depending solely on the price.  For example, D-340 is [[Philip K. Dick]]'s &quot;Solar Lottery&quot;; there is no S-340 because the number is taken by D-340.  Each of the remaining letter series titles had independent numbering.

* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range unknown.  Listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia but no examples in index.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1961 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1964 to 1968.
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1967.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963 to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1967 to 1968.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.

For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

==Ace Titles==

Ace titles are frequently collected, both for their covers, and by collectors of the individual genres.  The following articles provide lists of these titles, organized by genre and by format (e.g. [[dos-a-dos]] vs. normal format).

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

From its founding through to [[1971]] its editor in chief was [[Donald A. Wollheim]] who, in addition to publishing conventional paperbacks, also  instigated the [[Ace Double]] format, printing two short books together [[dos-a-dos]] (i. e., upside down with respect to one another so that there were two front covers and the two texts met in the middle, perhaps with a page or two of house ads between them). Books by established authors were usually bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit. The Ace Doubles format continued until the mid-[[1970s]].

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors. 

Major authors published by Ace include:

* [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]
* [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]
* [[Frank Herbert]]
* [[Philip K. Dick]]
* [[John_Brunner_(novelist)|John Brunner]]
* [[Fritz Leiber]]

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

[[Category:Book publishing companies of the United States]]</rev><rev revid="50928631" parentid="50913398" user="Mike Christie" userid="1239045" timestamp="2006-04-30T19:33:29Z" size="10065" contentformat="text/x-wiki" contentmodel="wikitext" xml:space="preserve">'''Ace Books''' is the oldest continuing [[publisher]] of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[novels]], founded in [[1952]] by [[magazine]] publisher [[A. A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

From its founding through to [[1971]] its editor in chief was [[Donald A. Wollheim]] who, in addition to publishing conventional paperbacks, also  instigated the [[Ace Double]] format, printing two short books together [[dos-a-dos]] (i. e., upside down with respect to one another so that there were two front covers and the two texts met in the middle, perhaps with a page or two of house ads between them). Books by established authors were usually bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit. The Ace Doubles format continued until the mid-[[1970s]].

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors. 

Major authors published by Ace include:

* [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]
* [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]
* [[Frank Herbert]]
* [[Philip K. Dick]]
* [[John_Brunner_(novelist)|John Brunner]]
* [[Fritz Leiber]]
* [[Samuel R. Delany]]

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.

[[Category:Book publishing companies of the United States]]</rev><rev revid="51089746" parentid="50933797" user="Mike Christie" userid="1239045" timestamp="2006-05-01T19:42:28Z" size="10102" contentformat="text/x-wiki" contentmodel="wikitext" xml:space="preserve">'''Ace Books''' is the oldest continuing [[publisher]] of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[novels]], founded in [[1952]] by [[magazine]] publisher [[A. A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

From its founding through to [[1971]] its editor in chief was [[Donald A. Wollheim]] who, in addition to publishing conventional paperbacks, also  instigated the [[Ace Double]] format, printing two short books together [[dos-a-dos]] (i. e., upside down with respect to one another so that there were two front covers and the two texts met in the middle, perhaps with a page or two of house ads between them). Books by established authors were usually bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit. The Ace Doubles format continued until the mid-[[1970s]].

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors. 

Major authors published by Ace include:

* [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson]]
* [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]
* [[Frank Herbert]]
* [[Philip K. Dick]]
* [[John_Brunner_(novelist)|John Brunner]]
* [[Fritz Leiber]]
* [[Samuel R. Delany]]
* [[Harlan Ellison]]
* [[Leigh Brackett]]
* [[Poul Anderson]]
* [[A. E. Van Vogt]]
* [[Jack Vance]]
* [[Michael Swanwick]]
* [[Lucius Shepard]]
* [[Neil R. Jones]] ([[Future history]] anthology)


== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

== Serial numbers ==
Ace titles have had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; or &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; or &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price, as given in the following list, which also shows the date range for which each letter prefix was in use.

* D-series.  Price 35¢.  Date range: 1952 to 1965.
* S-series.  Price 25¢.  Date range: 1954 to 1958.
* T-series.  Price 40¢.  Note that this prefix is listed in [[Donald H. Tuck|Tuck]]'s Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources.  This series may not exist.
* F-series.  Price 40¢.  Date range 1960 to 1967.
* M-series.  Price 45¢.  Date range 1964 to 1966 or 1967.
* G-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series.  Price 50¢.  Date range 1959 to 1968.
* H-series.  Price 60¢.  Date range 1965 or 1966 to 1968.
* A-series.  Price 75¢.  Date range 1963? to 1968.
* N-series.  Price 95¢.  Date range 1966? to 1968?.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a [[western (genre)|western]] in [[dos-a-dos]] format: [[Keith Vining]]'s ''Too Hot For Hell'' backed with [[Samuel W. Taylor]]'s ''The Grinning Gismo''.  That series continued until D-599, which was [[Patricia Libby]]'s ''Winged Victory for Nurse Kelly''; but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price.  The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e. [[dos-a-dos]]) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not [[dos-a-dos]], although none of the [[dos-a-dos]] titles have an S serial number.   The letter only indicates the price.

After this initial series, the F series was begun, at a new price level, and thereafter there were always several different letter series running simultaneously.  The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G series acquired its own prefix starting with G-501.  Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper.  All series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101.

In January 1969, Ace switched to a numeric coding system.  The code depended on the title of the book; or specifically on the first significant word in the title.  For example, [[Tom Purdom]]'s ''The Barons of Behavior'' was published by Ace in about 1972 as serial number 04760.  The first letter of &quot;Barons&quot; is &quot;B&quot;, so the code assigned is fairly early in the numeric range 00000 to 99999.  This procedure for assigning numeric codes was in use at Ace at least into the early 1990's, and may still be in use today.  For Ace doubles, one of the titles was selected and used to determine what serial number should be used.  For example, 11560 is the Ace double ''The Communipaths'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], backed with [[Louis Trimble]]'s ''The Noblest Experiment in the Galaxy''.  The serial number here is derived from ''The Communipaths''; a serial number derived from the Trimble would have been about 58000.

A. Wyn]]. It is [[As of 2004|now]] a part of [[Berkley Books]] a [[paperback]] [[imprint]] of [[Penguin Group (USA)]].

From its founding through to [[1971]] its editor in chief was [[Donald A. Wollheim]] who, in addition to publishing conventional paperbacks, also  instigated the [[Ace Double]] format, printing two short books together [[dos-a-dos]] (i. e., upside down with respect to one another so that there were two front covers and the two texts met in the middle, perhaps with a page or two of house ads between them). Books by established authors were usually bound together with those by less well-known ones, the theory being that this would help the more obscure authors gain popularity in their own right. The main drawback to the Doubles format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages), so that one or both would often be cut to fit. The Ace Doubles format continued until the mid-[[1970s]].

In [[1965]] Wollheim discovered a [[copyright]] loophole in the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Allen &amp; Unwin|George Allen &amp; Unwin]] edition.  This placed them outside of US [[copyright law]] as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]]. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

In [[1964]] [[Terry Carr]] had joined the company and in [[1968]] he initiated the [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Science Fiction Special]] line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as [[Alexei Panshin]], [[R. A. Lafferty]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]].

During the mid-late 1960s Ace also obtained licenses to publish original novels based upon several popular television series of the day, most notably ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual ''Year's Best Science Fiction'' [[anthology]] series.

In [[1971]] they both left Ace and went on to edit separate Year's Best volumes. Wollheim founded [[DAW Books]]. Carr returned in [[1984]] as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels, almost all from newer authors.
